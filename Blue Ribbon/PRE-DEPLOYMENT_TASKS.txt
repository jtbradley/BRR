Before pushing updates to the live web application:


1. Go to Controllers > AccountController approx line 216. This sets the default permissions for new people signing up.
   For dev/test, it's setup to make new users as "campaignManager", but we need it set to "customer" for live site.

2. Go to Migrations > Configuration.cs file and comment out ALL code in the SEED method.

3. If model changes have been made we need to be sure to check "Code First MIgrations" on deployment options.

4. Set Paypal settings to live settings.
